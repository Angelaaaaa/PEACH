//Actions are payloads of infromation that send data from application to store
//only one source of information for the store.
//Action creators are exactly thatâ€”functions that create actions.
//In Redux action creators simply return an action:

/*The dispatch() function can be accessed directly from the store 
as store.dispatch(), but more likely you'll access it using a 
helper like react-redux's connect(). You can use 
bindActionsCreators() to automatically bind many action creators to 
a dispatch() function.
